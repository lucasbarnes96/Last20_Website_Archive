   ```
   This will start a local server on http://localhost:8000 and automatically open your browser.

2. **Using Python's built-in server**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

3. **Using Node.js (if you have it installed)**:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
