But in reality, anyone can wear any colour they choose, regardless of gender. With the rise of gender-neutral fashion, it\u2019s time to break free from these outdated ideas and explore the world of colour in all its glory. Here\u2019s our guide to colour pairing that anyone can use to elevate their fashion game.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-c":"Start with the basics. Before diving into the world of bold colour combinations, it\u2019s important to have a solid foundation of basic colours in your wardrobe. Black, white, grey and navy are all versatile and timeless colours that pair well with anything. Once you have a good mix of these basics, you can start experimenting with more colourful pieces.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-d":"Stick to complementary colours. Complementary colours are those that sit opposite each other on the colour wheel. For example, blue and orange, red and green and yellow and purple are all complementary pairs. When paired together, complementary colours create a striking contrast that can be both bold and harmonious.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-e":"Experiment with monochromatic looks. Monochromatic outfits are made up of different shades and tints of the same colour. For example, a navy sweater paired with light blue jeans and navy shoes creates a cohesive and stylish look. Monochromatic outfits are easy to put together and can be a great way to add depth and interest to your wardrobe.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-f":"Mix warm and cool tones. Warm colours, like red, orange and yellow, have a fiery and energetic feel, while cool colours, like blue, green and purple, have a calming and soothing effect. By mixing warm and cool tones, you can create a balance of energy and tranquility in your outfits. For example, a burgundy sweater paired with light blue jeans and brown boots creates a warm and inviting look.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-g":"Have fun with patterns. Patterns can be a great way to add colour and interest to your outfits. When mixing patterns, it\u2019s important to choose complementary colours and patterns that are different in scale. For example, a small polka dot shirt paired with a larger striped blazer creates a fun and playful look.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-h":"In conclusion, colour pairing is all about experimentation and having fun. Don\u2019t be afraid to mix and match colours and patterns to create your own unique style. With these tips in mind, you\u2019ll be well on your way to creating stylish and gender-neutral outfits that showcase your personality and individuality.","theme.clothiers.34-slow-response-banner-date":"July 6, 2023","theme.clothiers.35-slow-response-banner-headline":"A slow response to fast fashion.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-a":"We're taking a closer look at the impact of this trend and why slow fashion is more important than ever.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-b":"Fast fashion has been a topic of debate for years, with many experts and activists highlighting the negative impact it has on the environment and the workers who make the clothes. However, despite the numerous critiques and calls for change, the trend of fast fashion seems to only be getting stronger. In this post, we're exploring why this is the case and why slow fashion is more important than ever.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-c":"One of the reasons why fast fashion has continued to thrive is its affordability. With prices so low, consumers are able to purchase more clothes than ever before, leading to a culture of overconsumption. This culture is fueled by the constant pressure to keep up with the latest trends and to always have something new to wear. Unfortunately, this mindset often means that clothes are only worn a few times before being thrown away, adding to the already massive amount of textile waste in landfills.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-d":"Another factor that contributes to the popularity of fast fashion is the lack of transparency in the industry. Most consumers have no idea where their clothes come from, who made them or under what conditions. This lack of information makes it easy for companies to exploit workers and to engage in environmentally harmful practices without fear of being held accountable.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-e":"Despite the challenges, there are some positive signs of change. The rise of slow fashion, which prioritizes ethical and sustainable practices, has gained momentum in recent years. More and more consumers are becoming aware of the negative impact of fast fashion and are looking for alternative ways to shop. This has led to an increase in the number of sustainable and ethical brands, as well as a growing interest in second-hand shopping.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-f":"In conclusion, while fast fashion continues to dominate the industry, it's important to remember that there are other options. Slow fashion offers a more ethical and sustainable approach to fashion, one that values quality over quantity and puts people and the planet first. By supporting sustainable and ethical brands, and by making more conscious choices about what we wear and how we shop, we can all play a part in creating a more just and sustainable fashion industry.","theme.clothiers.37-spring-2023-banner-date":"July 6, 2023","theme.clothiers.38-spring-2023-banner-headline":"The spring 2023 lookbook is here.","theme.clothiers.39-spring-2023-text-paragraph-a":"Spring is in the air and we're excited to unveil our latest collection in The Clothiers Spring 2023 Lookbook.

For too long, we\u2019ve been told that certain colours are meant for men and others for women. But in reality, anyone can wear any colour they choose, regardless of gender. With the rise of gender-neutral fashion, it\u2019s time to break free from these outdated ideas and explore the world of colour in all its glory. Here\u2019s our guide to colour pairing that anyone can use to elevate their fashion game.`,"theme.olive-gloria.41-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-part2-bullet1":"Start with the basics. Before diving into the world of bold colour combinations, it\u2019s important to have a solid foundation of basic colours in your wardrobe.

Once you have a good mix of these basics, you can start experimenting with more colourful pieces.","theme.olive-gloria.42-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-part2-bullet2":"Stick to complementary colours. Complementary colours are those that sit opposite each other on the colour wheel. For example, blue and orange, red and green and yellow and purple are all complementary pairs. When paired together, complementary colours create a striking contrast that can be both bold and harmonious.","theme.olive-gloria.43-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-part2-bullet3":"Experiment with monochromatic looks. Monochromatic outfits are made up of different shades and tints of the same colour. For example, a navy sweater paired with light blue jeans and navy shoes creates a cohesive and stylish look. Monochromatic outfits are easy to put together and can be a great way to add depth and interest to your wardrobe.","theme.olive-gloria.44-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-part2-bullet4":"Mix warm and cool tones. Warm colours, like red, orange and yellow, have a fiery and energetic feel, while cool colours, like blue, green and purple, have a calming and soothing effect. By mixing warm and cool tones, you can create a balance of energy and tranquility in your outfits. For example, a burgundy sweater paired with light blue jeans and brown boots creates a warm and inviting look.","theme.olive-gloria.45-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-part2-bullet5":"Have fun with patterns. Patterns can be a great way to add colour and interest to your outfits. When mixing patterns, it\u2019s important to choose complementary colours and patterns that are different in scale. For example, a small polka dot shirt paired with a larger striped blazer creates a fun and playful look.","theme.olive-gloria.46-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-part3":"In conclusion, colour pairing is all about experimentation and having fun. Don\u2019t be afraid to mix and match colours and patterns to create your own unique style.

\r
Fast fashion has been a topic of debate for years, with many experts and activists highlighting the negative impact it has on the environment and the workers who make the clothes. However, despite the numerous critiques and calls for change, the trend of fast fashion seems to only be getting stronger. In this post, we're exploring why this is the case and why slow fashion is more important than ever.\r
\r
One of the reasons why fast fashion has continued to thrive is its affordability. With prices so low, consumers are able to purchase more clothes than ever before, leading to a culture of overconsumption. This culture is fueled by the constant pressure to keep up with the latest trends and to always have something new to wear. Unfortunately, this mindset often means that clothes are only worn a few times before being thrown away, adding to the already massive amount of textile waste in landfills.\r
\r
Another factor that contributes to the popularity of fast fashion is the lack of transparency in the industry. Most consumers have no idea where their clothes come from, who made them, or under what conditions. This lack of information makes it easy for companies to exploit workers and to engage in environmentally harmful practices without fear of being held accountable.\r
\r
Despite the challenges, there are some positive signs of change. The rise of slow fashion, which prioritizes ethical and sustainable practices, has gained momentum in recent years. More and more consumers are becoming aware of the negative impact of fast fashion and are looking for alternative ways to shop. This has led to an increase in the number of sustainable and ethical brands, as well as a growing interest in secondhand shopping.\r
\r
In conclusion, while fast fashion continues to dominate the industry, it's important to remember that there are other options. Slow fashion offers a more ethical and sustainable approach to fashion, one that values quality over quantity and puts people and the planet first. By supporting sustainable and ethical brands, and by making more conscious choices about what we wear and how we shop, we can all play a part in creating a more just and sustainable fashion industry.`,"theme.olive-gloria.5-home-header-nav5":"Locations","theme.olive-gloria.50-lookbook-banner-date":"May 10, 2023","theme.olive-gloria.51-lookbook-banner-headline":"The spring lookbook is here.","theme.olive-gloria.52-lookbook-text-paragraph1":"Spring is in the air and we're excited to unveil our latest collection in our Spring Lookbook.","theme.olive-gloria.53-lookbook-text-paragraph2":"Check it out.","theme.olive-gloria.54-lookbook-text-paragraph3":`The long-awaited arrival of spring means that it's time to refresh our wardrobes with new and exciting pieces.

Ensure that your flowers have been properly hydrated by trimming their stems at an angle and placing them in water for a few hours before arranging.\r
\r
Next, select a focal flower or two that will be the centrepiece of your bouquet. Arrange them at different heights, cutting their stems at varying lengths to add dimension. Surround these focal flowers with complementary blooms, staggering them for a balanced look. Don\u2019t forget to include some greenery like eucalyptus or ferns to add texture and depth. As you add each element, secure the bouquet with floral tape, wrapping it tightly around the stems. Finally, cover the tape with a decorative ribbon or twine, leaving a few inches of stems exposed for a polished finish.

From design to production, every step along the supply chain plays a crucial role in shaping the final product. Now more than ever, consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of the impact their choices have on the environment and the people involved in the creation of their clothing. When it comes to fabric, where it comes from matters. Embracing ethical and sustainable fashion means understanding the significance of sourcing fabrics from responsible suppliers who prioritize transparency, fair trade practices, and environmental stewardship.\r
\r
Ethical and sustainable fashion starts at the source\u2014the fabric. By opting for fabrics that are responsibly and ethically produced, we can contribute to a more just and eco-friendly fashion industry. The journey of a sustainable fabric begins with the cultivation of natural fibres or the responsible manufacturing of synthetic materials. Organic cotton, for example, is grown without harmful pesticides, protecting both the environment and the workers involved in its production. Fabrics made from recycled materials reduce waste and contribute to a circular economy. Additionally, choosing fabrics with certifications such as Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) or Bluesign\xAE ensures that they have been manufactured under stringent environmental and social criteria. By selecting fabrics that align with these ethical standards, we support a healthier planet and a fairer fashion industry.\r
\r
Understanding where your fabric comes from empowers you to make informed choices as a consumer. It allows you to support brands that prioritize ethical sourcing, fair labour practices, and environmental conservation. By investing in clothing made from responsibly sourced fabrics, you contribute to a sustainable future while also enjoying high-quality garments that stand the test of time. The impact of our choices extends beyond personal style; it influences the fashion industry at large. By demanding transparency and sustainability, we can drive positive change, encouraging brands to adopt ethical practices and promoting a more conscious approach to fashion.\r
\r
Every garment has a story, and it is within our power as consumers to shape that story for the better. By considering the origin of our fabrics, we can contribute to a more sustainable and equitable fashion industry. Let us embrace the power of informed choices, supporting brands that prioritize ethical sourcing, fair labour conditions, and environmental stewardship. Together, we can weave a future where fashion is not just a means of self-expression but also a force for positive change in the world.
